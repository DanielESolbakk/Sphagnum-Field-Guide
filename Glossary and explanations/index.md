## Sphagnum Structure

The chapters below will serve as a guide for understanding the most important parts of sphagnum used to identify them. It also serves as a general overview of the structural organization of sphagnum. 

A sphagnum consists of:

* A {% include tooltip.html term="capitulum" text="capitulum" %} which serves as a head and sits at the top of the {% include tooltip.html term="stem" text="stem" %}

* Branches which lays flat to or sticks out from the stem

* Leaves, of which it has two types, one type which form the main parts of the branches and the other type which lays flat to or sticks out from the stem

### Capitulum

### Stem

### Branches

### Leaves

### Hyalocysts

### Fibrils

Fibrills are essentially spiral- or rip-like structures helping to sustain a certain form. When water is evaporating out of the plant the negative turgor could cause cavities to collapse. This would of course hindering the water intake. Often structures under that kind of physical stress (negative pressures) have that kind of structures, e.g. our windpipe or the a vacuum cleaner's tube.  
Although fibrills are a general trait of branch leaves in most Sphagnales, the derived stem leaves do not have that need for this function of conduct water. For Sphagnum species that don't normally have stem leaf fibrils, when water stress is high enough this trait can be seen as an rudimental feature in stem leaves again.
