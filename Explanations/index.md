# Explanations

## Growth Patterns

Sphagnum grow upwards or prostrate depending on the relative wetness and species.

## Sphagnum Structure

The chapters below will serve as a guide for understanding the most important parts of sphagnum used to identify them. It also serves as a general overview of the structural organization of sphagnum.

A sphagnum consists of:

* A {% include tooltip.html term="capitulum" text="capitulum" %} which serves as a head and sits at the top of the {% include tooltip.html term="stem" text="stem" %}

* Branches which lays flat to or sticks out from the stem

* Leaves, of which it has two types, one type which covers the branches and the other type which lays flat on or sticks out from the stem

### Capitulum

The head or capitulum of a sphagnum is a cluster of young branches at the top of the stem. As the stem grows the capitulum branches will end up as the adult branches you can spot further down the stem. The capitulum is often star like in shape, especially when viewed from above, and often has a visible top bud. The {% include tooltip.html term="stellate" text="stellateness" %} of the capitulum is often used as an identifying trait for certain species. The top bud or lack thereof, as well as how the capitulum branches rotate and curve is often a very useful identifying trait for certain species.  
Some species like S. annulatum always has a prominent top bud whereas a species like S. cuspidatum almost never has a visible top bud. It makes sense then that S. majus, which is a hybrid between the two, comes with a top bud visibility which slides to either extreme of the visiblity scale.

<img src="capitulum-majus.jpg" alt="Sphagnum majus capitulum"/>  
↑ Sphagnum majus, notice the star like shape of the head and the slightly hidden dark brown cylindrical top bud in the center. Also notice the unruly and "random" look of the small, central capitulum branches

<img src="capitulum-balticum.jpg" alt="Sphagnum balticum capitulum"/>  
↑ Sphagnum balticum, notice the less star like shape of the head and the lack of a easily visible top bud in the center. Also notice the straighter small, central capitulum branches and branch leaves as compared to sphagnum majus above

#### Additional Capitulum Examples { .collapse }

<img src="capitulum-molle.jpg" alt="capitulum-molle.jpg"/>  
↑ Sphagnum molle, more or less flat capitulum where it's hard to seperate single sphagnums from each other. S. molle is normally not star shaped nor equiped with a visible top bud.

<img src="capitulum-obtusum.jpg" alt="capitulum-obtusum.jpg"/>  
↑ Sphagnum obtusum, central small head branches turning inwards and hiding the top bud from view, also slightly stellate

<img src="capitulum-strictum-subnitens.jpg" alt="capitulum-strictum-subnitens.jpg"/>  
↑ Sphagnum strictum (green) and subnitens (red), S. strictum with its pompom like head makes it hard to think sphagnum can be star shaped. S. subnitens shows a bit of top bud in this picture (the slightly yellow central part of the capitula)

<img src="capitulum-teres.jpg" alt="capitulum-teres.jpg"/>  
↑ Sphagnum teres, the classic star shaped and visible top bud combo

<img src="capitulum-cuspidatum.jpg" alt="capitulum-cuspidatum.jpg"/>  
↑ Sphagnum cuspidatum, also nicknamed "drowned cat" for its formless and chaotic capitula (but this is only when it is growing very wet)

### Stem

The stem of sphagnum is also sometimes used as a identifying trait for specific species. Flatberg has written about how certain species' stem snap easily, whilst others bend. I often use the colour of the stem as one trait in identification. For example S. girgensohnii cannot have a red stem (they can have brown and orange stems though), whilst the very similar species S. russowii does often have at least red speckles in it stem. Therefore, if you find a S. girgensohnii with red in its stem, it should point you towards checking other identifying traits for S. russowii or other lookalikes that can have red in its stem.  
Some sphagnum have alternate permanent colour forms. For example S. russowii, which sometimes shows up completely orange. However, the stem will still have its traditional colouring of a sliding and speckled scale of green to red. The same logic also follows other sphagnum with alternate permanent colour forms.

#### Stem Cross Section

After cutting a {% include tooltip.html term="cross section" text="cross section" %} from a sphagnum's stem you will see three often distinct layers. These, especially the cortex, or the lack of these are sometimes used as an identifying trait of certain sphagunm species. Sometimes these layers are difficult to see the difference between these layers.

<img src="cross-section-stem-russowii.png" alt="cross-section-stem-russowii.png"/>  
↑ Sphagnum russowii stem cross section, image source: [Bartosz Czołczyński](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/bagli), [Inaturalist 31.12.25](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/328391996), edited by me to differentiate layers with text and contrast  

* The {% include tooltip.html term="cortex" text="cortex" %} is the outermost zone of the stem when looking at a cross section. It consists of large cortical cells. The number of layers, or relative lack of {% include tooltip.html term="cortical" text="cortical" %} cells is sometimes used as an identifying trait of certain sphagnum species.

* The {% include tooltip.html term="scleroderm" text="scleroderm" %} is the layer underneath the cortex. These thicker and smaller cells are often more clearly coloured. The colours vary and depends on the species of the sphagnum and is sometimes used as a identifying trait for certain species.

* The central parenchyma, which is the inermost layer.

<img src="cross-section-stem-annulatum.jpg" alt="cross-section-stem-annulatum.jpg"/>
↑ Sphagnum annulatum stem cross section, with parts of the cortical cells completely lacking. One of the species traits of S. annulatum is a poorly developed or lacking stem cortical cells, as opposed to S. jensenii (a hybrid between S. annulatum and S. balticum) which should have ~3 layers of cortical cells.

#### Stem Cortex Closeup

<img src="stem-affine.jpg" alt="stem-affine.jpg"/>
↑ Sphagnum affine, here's a closeup of the stem of a sphagnum. Notice the round circles (pores) attached to square like see through layer of cortical cells? That is the {% include tooltip.html term="cortex" text="cortex" %}. The brown cyllinder that you can see through the cortex is the afformentioned layer called {% include tooltip.html term="scleroderm" text="scleroderm" %}.

<img src="stem-stained-affine.jpg" alt="stem-stained-affine.jpg"/>
↑ Sphagnum affine, here is the same picture as above but stained with purple ink. This makes it easier to see the seethrough cortical cells and their pores. Many sphagnum do not have pores in the cortical cells. These types of pores are found in all sphagnum subgenus Sphagnum, and some Acutifolia.

<img src="stem-cortex-stained-affine.jpg" alt="stem-cortex-stained-affine.jpg"/>
↑ Sphagnum affine, here's the stem cortex ripped off the stem. You can now very easily see the cortical cells and the pores.

<img src="stem-cortex-fibrills-stained-affine.jpg" alt="stem-cortex-fibrills-stained-affine.jpg"/>
↑ Sphagnum affine, on the back of the cortical cells you can sometimes find {% include tooltip.html term="fibrils" text="fibrils" %}. Those are the "wrinkles" you can see criss-crossing the cortical cells in this image. Notice that this image is the exact same image as above, except the focus of the lens was set on the back instead of the front of the cortical cells. Also notice that all sphagnum subgenus Sphagnum has these fibrils in their cortical cells.

### Branches

Sphagnum branches are attached to the stem in {% include tooltip.html term="fascicle" text="fascicles" %}. These bundles of branches are split into two types. The {% include tooltip.html term="spreading branches" text="divergent" %} branches and the {% include tooltip.html term="pendent branches" text="pendent" %} branches.

### Leaves

### Hyalocysts

### Fibrils

Fibrills are essentially spiral- or rip-like structures helping to sustain a certain form. When water is evaporating out of the plant the negative turgor could cause cavities to collapse. This would of course hindering the water intake. Often structures under that kind of physical stress (negative pressures) have that kind of structures, e.g. our windpipe or the a vacuum cleaner's tube.  
Although fibrills are a general trait of branch leaves in most Sphagnales, the derived stem leaves do not have that need for this function of conduct water. For Sphagnum species that don't normally have stem leaf fibrils, when water stress is high enough this trait can be seen as an rudimental feature in stem leaves again.
