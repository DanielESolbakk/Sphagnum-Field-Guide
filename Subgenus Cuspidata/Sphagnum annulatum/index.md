<a id="general"></a>
### General

Sphagnum annulatum is relatively constant in both macroscopic and microscopic characters. But is still varying from **small to moderate**, from green, **yellow** to **chestnut-brown** to sometimes orange-brown or red-brown. It's always glossy looking when moist (due to the many pores in its branch leaves). A completely green color variant exists but is rare.  

Commonly it has:

- A very prominent top bud which is never hidden by its inner capitulum branches
- A clearly star shaped capitulum
- A brown or orange colour
- A mostly pale stem with longer than wide stem leaves, which stick out from the stem
- Divergent branches with very short leaves at the base
- Branch leaves which are unranked and erecto-patent to imbricate in arrangement
- Branch leaf {% include tooltip.html term="hyalocyst" text="hyaline cells" %} very porose and in rows of one to two throughout and on both sides of the leaf
- Undifferentiated stem {% include tooltip.html term="cortex" text="cortex" %}

<a id="capitulum"></a>
### {% include tooltip.html term="capitulum" text="Capitulum" %}

The {% include tooltip.html term="capitulum" text="capitulum" %}forms a slightly to distinctly {% include tooltip.html term="stellate" text="stellate" %} head. When viewed from above the **outer branches are straight to somewhat laterally curved**. And when viewed from the side they are **distinctly {% include tooltip.html term="arcuato decurved" text="arcuato-decurved" %}**. The {% include tooltip.html term="apical bud" text="apical bud" %}is well developed and usually **equals or exceeds the inner branches in length, remaining clearly exposed rather than concealed**. In male plants during autumn, the capitulum becomes strongly convex and bears short, {% include tooltip.html term="clavate" text="clavate" %}antheridial branches.

<a id="branches"></a>
### Branches

{% include tooltip.html term="fascicle" text="Fascicles" %} are usually situated loosely on the stem. Most of them carry two divergent branches with one or two {% include tooltip.html term="pendent branches" text="pendent branches" %} that most often stick a little out from the stem.  

The **divergent branches often curve towards the ground and tend to be thickest at the middle section of the branch.** The branch axis is often slightly reddish near the base.  
Along a divergent branch the branch leaves near the proximal end are **much shorter than those in the middle**, where they are broadly ovate-lanceolate, and in *S. annulatum* these tiny leaves is often very noticable (with a loupe). **Divergent branch leaves are unranked and can range from erecto-patent to commonly clearly {% include tooltip.html term="imbricate" text="imbricate" %}.** Sometimes with **few to many leaves appearing straight to very {% include tooltip.html term="subsecund" text="subsecund" %}.**  

The pendent branches are normally more slender and shorter than the divergent branches.  

<a id="stem"></a>
### Stem

**The stem is pale**, sometimes with reddish-orange-lightbrown portions, especially when growing very wet and it being late in the season.  

**The stem leaves are more or less spread away from the stem itself** and are longer than wide. They are {% include tooltip.html term="lingulate" text="lingulate" %} to lingulate-triangular, medium to very curved concavely, and more often than not broadest at or just above the base. The tip is usually acute to a slightly bluntly acute, and only rarely narrowly truncate-erose at the very tip. On male plants the stem leaves are relatively shorter and broader, with a more obtuse apex than in females.  

<a id="variation"></a>
### Variation

In the field it behaves as a fairly phenorigid species. Both the macroscopic and microscopic characters stay quite constant for a sphagnum species. Within mires it usually occupies only a short bit of the "dry-wet" ecogradient. Under its ordinary minerotrophic mire conditions the plants are mostly medium sized and **chestnut-brown**, as seen in the images at the top of this page. The capitulum branches look relatively straight when viewed from above.  
In {% include tooltip.html term="fen" text="fen" %} vegetation, especially in subalpine and alpine areas, plants are often dark orange to red-brown with a more strongly curved capitulum and more imbricate divergent branch leaves.  
There also exists a very rare permanently green morph.

#### Variation - Macroscopic Pictures { .collapse }

Below are some examples of how *S. annulatum* can look in the field. All of the plants shown are non-permanent forms that change with the season, the local "dry-wet" gradient and the "poor-rich" gradient.

### Habitat { .collapse }

*S. annulatum* works as an indicator of {% include tooltip.html term="minerotrophic peatland" text="minerotrophic wetlands" %}, and it is not found in {% include tooltip.html term="ombrotrophic peatland" text="ombrotrophic bogs" %}.  

The species is predominantly a {% include tooltip.html term="mire" text="mire" %} plant. In Norway it also turns up in subalpine and low alpine areas, where it can grow in spring and snow-bed vegetation on very shallow peat. It is only found in minerotrophic conditions. It is most typical of sloping {% include tooltip.html term="fen" text="fens" %}, but can also occur in {% include tooltip.html term="topogenous" text="topogenous" %} fens.  
Along the "poor-rich" vegetation gradient its ecological range is fairly narrow: it is found mainly in **{% include tooltip.html term="intermediate fen" text="intermediate fens" %}**, occasionally in transitional **{% include tooltip.html term="poor fen" text="poor fens" %}** and only rarely in **{% include tooltip.html term="rich fen" text="rich fens" %}**. On the "hummock-mud-bottom" vegetation gradient it usually forms high-level {% include tooltip.html term="carpet" text="carpets" %} and {% include tooltip.html term="lawn" text="lawns" %}; it is less often seen in wetter carpets and only seldom at the beginning of the {% include tooltip.html term="hummock" text="hummock" %} level.
